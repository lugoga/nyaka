<p>Recently, Joyland School celebrated the cultural day. The event occurred On Friday 16, August 2019, at the Joyland ground. The annual Cultural Day was eagerly anticipated and after much effort preparing performances from around the world, students revealed in the opportunity to celebrate their cultural identities. Parents were welcomed to attend the event and the day was gorgeous! <br></br></p>
<p>With a theme of the day <strong>Celebrating and Appreciating Cultural Diversity in Tanzania and Beyond</strong>, I realized the diverse and multi-cultural of different communities in my country and the cultural of other people outside Tanzania. It was lovely to see my fellow students dressed in clothes from different cultures and the staff looked great as well!</p>

<p>I realized that celebrating African’s rich cultural heritage is not only necessary, but of utmost priority. This is what informed the celebration of Cultural Day in the school, where everybody was dressed in gorgeous indigenous cultural attires and various songs were rendered in local languages.<br></br></p>
<p>The day started with students spent time with their own teachers—discussing the cultures that were represented in their class. Some children were lucky enough to have parents visit and observe the performance of our cultural dance along with beliefs, values and traditions. <br></br></p>
<p>On his part, the director of Joyland School, Mr. Fredrick Otieno, described the event as remarkable, saying <em>it would make a great impact on the lives of the students</em>. He advised parents to encourage their children to speak their various mother tongues.<br></br></p>
<p>I appreciate families that supported an event by any moral support and dressing their children in their cultural outfits. I can’t wait to do it all again next year! <br></br></p>
<p>I made a short video clip for those who missed an event to have a glimpse of the celebration. Enjoy presence even if you missed it!</p>
