It was on the Saturday 14, October in 2017, when my parents and my young brother Daniel Joined Dr. Magreth to Congratulate Kelvin for enduring his A-level studies at Tumsime High School. I was excited and never had deep sleep on that day. I was so nervous on the day, hoping to see my friends, the twins on the events. We started the journey to Tabata early around 8 `A.M` and it took us like one hour and tweny minutes. Katika sura hiyo na katika mistari minne tuliyoitumia, kuna mambo takribani saba muhimu sana ambayo katika ukurasa wetu wa kwanza hatukuyaeleza yote. Na mambo hayo saba yote ndiyo yaliyobeba maudhui ya ukura wetu. <br></br>
