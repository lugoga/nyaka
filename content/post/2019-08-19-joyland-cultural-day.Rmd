Recently the Joyland School celebrated the cultural day. On Friday 16, August 2019, the management of Joyland International School Organized a cultural day at the Joyland ground. 

Parents were welcome to attend the event and the day proved to be an informative and enjoyable celebration of our traditional culture. The annual Cultural Day was eagerly anticipated and after much effort  preparing performances from around the world, students revelled in the opportunity to celebrate their cultural identities. <br></br>

Given the different tribes in Tanzania, we are part of a diverse, multi-cultural community and it was fantastic to celebrate this with children and their families. It was lovely to see so many children dressing in clothes from their own or others cultures and the staff looked great as well! <br></br>

For students, parents and members of staff of Joyland International School, Tanzania, celebrating African’s rich cultural heritage is not only necessary, but of utmost priority. This is what informed the celebration of Cultural Day in the school, where everybody was dressed in gorgeous indigenous cultural attires. Various songs were rendered in  local languages.<br></br>

The day started with students spent time with their own teachers---discussing the cultures that were represented in their class. Some children were lucky enough to have parents visit and observe the performance of our cultural dance along with beliefs, values and traditions. <br></br>

On his part, the director of Joyland, Mr. Otieno, described the event as remarkable, saying it would make a great impact on the lives of the students. He also advised parents to encourage their children speak their various mother tongues.<br></br>

Thank you to all the families who made such an effort to dress their children in their cultural outfits, came into speak to the children or provided food for our after school celebration.
We can’t wait to do it all again next year!
