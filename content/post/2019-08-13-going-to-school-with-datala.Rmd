I Welcome you again to my blog and in this post I briefly narrate to you the experience I had during summer holiday. As you know that I am candidate to sit for grade four national examination in October, the Joyland Management decided that we should continue with classes even when others are on holiday.  <br></br>

The school is located at Toangoma, about 26 kilometers from Dege---my home place. So, I often cover about 50 kilometer for round trip to go to school and coming back home. With school bus and the absence of traffic Jam at Kigamboni, I had never notice the distance and the time I spend for a ride to school and back home. But, during the summer holiday, instead of sticking on the normal ride of school bus, I decided to go to school and come back home with a public transport---*daladala*. <br></br>

Unfortunate there is no direct *daladala* from home to school. Therefore, I had to use two *daladala*. I often left home around 6:15 `A.M` and walk from home to the *Nguzo mbili* bus stop, which is about 300 meters from home and wait for a bus. I had to wait for several minutes as conductors would passby and tell the driver not to stop because the passenger is just a <span>*dent*</span>. <br></br>

Once I got into the bus, I took us about 30 minutes from Dege to *Mji mwema*---a bus stop where I dropped and took another bus, that also took about 20 minutes and drop off at a bus stop near the school called *Nyumba Ya Njano*. Then walk to School a distance of about half a kilometer. <br></br>

I arrived at school around quarter to eight. The class run from 8:00 `A.M` to 12:30 `P.M`. We then went for lunch and departed back home. I rush to the main Road and got a *daladala*. I got into the bus that goes to **Kigamboni Ferry** and dropped at *Mji Mwemba* and connected to another bus that was going either *Mwembe Mdogo* or *Cheka* and dropped at *Nguzo Mbili*. Because of the few passengers during the mid day, I spent almost two and a half hours from *Nyumba ya Njano* to *Nguzo Mbili*.The online map below show the main bus stops. Click the symbol on the map to and the name of bus stop will popup. <br></br>

```{r, include=FALSE, fig.cap="Bus stop"}
require(magrittr)
bus.stops = data.frame(lon = c(39.465114,39.445151,39.355443,39.333255   ),
                       lat = c(-6.941757, -6.905261,-6.850445, -6.938208),
                       name = c("Cheka", "Nguzo Mbili","Mji Mwema", "Nyumba ya Njano"))

 # bus.stops %>% sf::st_as_sf(coords = c("lon", "lat")) %>% sf::st_set_crs(4326) %>% mapview::mapview()

```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
bus.stops %>% leaflet::leaflet() %>%
  leaflet::addTiles() %>%
  leaflet::addMarkers(lng = ~lon, lat = ~lat, popup = ~name)
```

That is my story on how I spend three weeks of going to school with a *<u>daladala</u>* during a summer holiday of June 2019. The next post I share with you the adventure I had for othe other two weeks before the school opened on July 01, 2019. Thank you for hanging around this post and hope to see you come again for more stories. Bye and be blessed!
